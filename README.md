Hey everyone! My name is **Linto**, and this repository is my dedicated space for learning, documenting, and experimenting with Artificial Intelligence. Think of it as my personal **AI Boot Camp**, where I'll be tracking my progress, jotting down notes, and showcasing the small projects and code snippets I build along the way.

My goal here is to make my AI learning journey transparent and organized, both for myself and potentially for anyone else interested in following along or picking up some tips!
